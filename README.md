The goal of the algorithm in this repository is to correct the pointing instability of a laser in an optical setup, using two motorized mirrors (PIM1, Thorlabs), a piezomotor (KIM101, Thorlabs), a flip mirror (MFF101, Thorlabs) and two cameras (Basler). The flip mirror can point the beam towards the camera, which can then sense the deviation of the laser beam from the target pixel. This deviation is translated to a certain movement in steps of the piezomotor, which moves the motorized mirrors. When the beam is at the target position, the calibration is finished. After the calibration is complete, the mirror flips again and the beam can continue in the path. 

To use the script, first the target image of the beam has to be made on both cameras. This should be done after the setup is fully aligned. Then, in the _algorithm_alignment_ script, some parameters need to be set. these parameters are the pixelsize (dependent on the camera used in the setup), the maximum number of attempts you want the algorithm to do for realignment before it quits, the distance between elements in your setup (A = distance between MM1 and MM2. B = distance between MM2 and cam1, C  = distance between cam1 and cam2). Lastly, the margin in number of pixels that the shift is allowed to have when the correction is 
considered 'good enough' needs to be set. In the script _functions_ the correct serial numbers for the cameras need to be set in the camera_controller class and the serial number of the piezomotor needs to be set in the 

Also, a calibration needs to be done to calculate a slope that can convert a number of motor steps to a number of pixel shifts on camera 2. This calibration can be done by running the script calibration_piezo. In the current state of the script, the calibrations can not be done all in one run, as the beam tends to drift off the reach of the camera after a few measurements. Therefore, measure one channel at a time, and if nessecery, steer the beam back within reach in between measurements to prevent the beam from leaving the sensor of the camera. 

Next, when the calibration is done, the parameters have been set and the target images have been made, algorithm_alignment can be run to realign the laser beam. The algorithm calculates the shift, then calculates how much each mirror needs to move, and then moves the  motorized mirror in the setup, steering the beam back to the target pixel. If the current shift is not yet within the margin of the target shift, the process is repeated. After a certain amount of attempts (max_attempts) the algorithm stops and returns what the deviation is to the target pixel is.
